Kids need to be taught to save and plan for the future, and take intelligent risks. They don&amp;#8217;t need to be told that life is full of absolutes. It&amp;#8217;s natural to grieve when someone goes into cryo, given that we don&amp;#8217;t know they will make it out again. Kids who know about the uncertainty of death (and life, come to that) aren&amp;#8217;t going to be weirder than the ones that don&amp;#8217;t. Yeah pizza is nice, but you can make your own at home cheaper. A little thrift isn&amp;#8217;t a bad thing. And something that gets you thinking about the longer term earlier in life is a good&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;

As for non-technical reasons how about the social contract?
When you pass on the majority of people leave their estate to their families. Leaving aside all the inevitable arguments about feeling shafted on grans will lets just look at the concept.  This passing on of material possessions helps with the pain of losing someone. Sometimes if your relatives were successfull it can change their whole situation by providing a much needed windfall and or a home. 
Also (depending on their beliefs of course) I worry about the chidren that are effected by cryonics. If they are told Granny isn&amp;#8217;t really dead but is frozen for storage and one day she might come back better than ever &amp;mdash; well that kinda sucks. The children don&amp;#8217;t really understand the concept of death and may well develop weird belief systems as a result. It&amp;#8217;s not fair to impose what i think is a almost religous belief in cryonics onto children. 
Thirdly using life-insurance to cover your cryonics may seem pretty unselfish way to go. But is it really, what if you die young and use up your 100K on a gamble instead of using it to provide your partner and or children? I suppose you could take out 2 seperate life insurance schemes but come on &amp;mdash; lets be serious who is going to do that. Hell people always get shafted on insurance in any case &amp;mdash; i say your better off using that monthly payment to get a nice pizza and enjoy your life.&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;

See &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/HowColdIsColdEnough.html"&gt;How cold is cold enough?&lt;/a&gt;.  For the example reaction they use, a month at dry ice temperatures is like an hour at body temperature: bad news that will certainly make her future reanimation harder and less likely, but not yet&amp;nbsp;hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll note that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN2&lt;/span&gt; is actually massive overkill compared to the temperatures they need: the perfect cryonics procedure would maintain the body above the glass transition temperature.  However, that would be much, much harder and less reliable, especially when you consider that variation in temperature will cause destructive thermal expansion and&amp;nbsp;contraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have enjoyed discussing this with a lot of people, but I can&amp;#8217;t say you&amp;#8217;ve been one of them; your derisive tone, your preference for breadth over depth, and your total lack of embarrassment at continually presenting me with one &lt;a rel="nofollow" href="http://commonsenseatheism.com/?p=230"&gt;fake gold chain after another&lt;/a&gt; has made it very unrewarding.  I&amp;#8217;m glad that other critics (including Liam, as you point out) have done so much&amp;nbsp;better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My organisational qualm is that they&amp;#8217;re small and shaky, as they admit. This story, and Alcor confirming the dodgy point in its press release, raises a &amp;#8220;What the fuck?&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A technical solution is to use bigger freezers as there gets to be more use for them. More total &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LN2&lt;/span&gt; / freezing energy, but less of it per unit volume and thus per patient. If you cube the volume, you square the surface area, so 1000 times the volume means only 100 times the heat&amp;nbsp;transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course from a social stability perspective putting all your eggs in one basket may seem the opposite of what you&amp;#8217;d want to do. The exception would be if this actually motivates people into doing more to create social&amp;nbsp;stability.&lt;/p&gt;
