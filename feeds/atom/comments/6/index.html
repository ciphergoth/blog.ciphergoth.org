He&amp;nbsp;writes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FWIW&lt;/span&gt; &amp;mdash; on consideration, I&amp;#8217;ve taken out the bit where I suggest that threatening to sue suggests they&amp;#8217;re pseudoscientists, and just left it at the bare fact that they did, because of the use of the word &amp;#8220;fraud&amp;#8221; &amp;mdash; David Gerard (talk) 21:52, 16 February 2010&amp;nbsp;(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTC&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you really believe that a non-pseudoscientific business, accused of actual fraud by a major body in a related area, would be very unlikely to threaten to&amp;nbsp;sue?&lt;/p&gt;

Litigation was only threatened for the use of the word &amp;#8220;fraud&amp;#8221;.  There was no attempt to pretend that legitimate questions about science constituted allegations of fraud, as there is with the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BCA&lt;/span&gt;/Singh case; the specific bone of contention was the use of the word &amp;#8220;fraud&amp;#8221; in relation to the core business of Alcor.  Hardly a business on the planet would not threaten to sue if they learned that you planned to brand them fraudsters as publically as&amp;nbsp;possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fraud is a legal term that means people are being deceived into losing money. Unless there is proof or strong evidence for this, claims that it &amp;#8220;borders on fraud&amp;#8221; serve no informative&amp;nbsp;purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Cryonicists also became intolerant of any public assertion on the part of cryobiologists that cryonics or its practitioners were engaged in fraud. Communications were sent apprising the Society that assertions that cryonics was fraud constituted both a serious criminal and civil allegation and that appropriate legal action would be taken if such allegations continued (cf. Series of letters from Robert Ettinger and Michael Darwin sent to the Society in the mid 1980&amp;#8217;s: specifically Letter from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;M.G.&lt;/span&gt; Darwin to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;H.T.&lt;/span&gt; Meryman dated 21 April, 1982). As a result, by and large, allegations of fraud&amp;nbsp;ceased.&lt;/p&gt;
