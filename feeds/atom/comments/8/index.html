I found it interesting because it doesn&amp;#8217;t seem, to me, that anyone responding to this is actually an expert in anything related to what Paul was asking.  I thought he was asking for expert opinions on why cryogenics is not plausible.  I am an expert in an affiliated area and have worked with cryogenics just to perform my work.  @ Paul, this is in no way to sound harsh or condescending, but it is implausible and the way to find these studies is to actually be an expert and have access to places such as medline instead of wikipedia.  I can&amp;#8217;t even begin to go into why cryogenics (in the magnitude you are describing) won&amp;#8217;t work because it would be out of your realm of knowledge from what I read that you posted.  That said, I could be wrong because I don&amp;#8217;t know you.  I understand your frustration on wanting to know why, but it is so completely complicated and with not having the appropriate background, I myself can&amp;#8217;t even begin to explain to you why.  That is not to belittle you in any way as I am sure you are an expert in an area I am not.  The take away point is that there is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TON&lt;/span&gt; of evidence/studies on the subject matter, but it&amp;#8217;s just not readily available for the lay person that doesn&amp;#8217;t study it.  Some believe it shouldn&amp;#8217;t be available for that very reason.  Point in case:  @ Luke- do you really know what a stem cell is?  I honestly cringe when the topic comes up in mainstream society because it&amp;#8217;s pretty much like cancer.  I didn&amp;#8217;t understand what cancer &lt;span class="caps"&gt;REALLY&lt;/span&gt; was until after med school and then training beyond that specifically dealt with cancer.  That&amp;#8217;s how complicated it is.  As far as stem cell research goes, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAVE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ACCESS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CELLS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WITHOUT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EMBRYOS&lt;/span&gt;- &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THEY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXIST&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AND&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SOME&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUTSTANDING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RESEARCH&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HAS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEEN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PERFORMED&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;USING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THEM&lt;/span&gt;!!!  Case in point here is Dolly the sheep.  She was cloned.  What alot of people don&amp;#8217;t know is there are several forms of clones.  She was the first of a certain type and was begat from her own somatic cell mammary tissue- not an embryo.  The whole thing was a fluke bc  they forgot to feed the cells and the result was they went into another stage of replication (dormant) that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONE&lt;/span&gt; was looking at as an alternative for cloning.  Stem cells are not the end all for everything.  Their use for diseases and the such is understandable.  When you get into cloning people and preserving your body to be revived later, that&amp;#8217;s just plain narcissism and quite frankly against nature itself.  If everyone lived forever, they&amp;#8217;d die of cancer.  It&amp;#8217;s how the body works.   There is a certain error in cell replication and you can&amp;#8217;t change that.  This has nothing to do with nano repair and fracturing from freezing.  Your body can only take so much and you die for a reason.
So basically, in a nutshell, get access to medline or some authentic peer reviewed medical/research journals and you will find your answers, but good luck understanding it.  It takes years of training and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TONS&lt;/span&gt; of experience to do what these guys do in their work.  For anyone that wants to pop off about this answer, examine yourself before you do so because it would be out of sheer insecurity if&amp;nbsp;done.&lt;/p&gt;

Would most of the information be recoverable in theory? My thought is that it would be, since the plastic pieces would take unique enough shapes (undistorted thanks to the cold temperature) that they could be pieced back together like a&amp;nbsp;puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brains seem to be redundant in nature. When you think about it, they have to store the same information in multiple places to be able to communicate between the various parts effectively. Some stroke victims have lost an entire hemisphere, iirc. Their remaining hemisphere took over, relearned what they needed to know. How much better would it be if you could simply regrow the lost&amp;nbsp;parts?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think if you lose 50% of your data you are probably the same person by a reasonable estimation. The less data is preserved the more likely we would be to think of you as a clone/progeny rather than the same person. But even that is worth something I would&amp;nbsp;think.&lt;/p&gt;

CDs by design use error correcting codes for handling scratches, and the coding itself is so far overkill that usually when a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; skips it&amp;#8217;s because it lost tracking not because the error correction failed, and tracking is a physical reading device problem rather than an information theoretic problem. The arc of the tracks and the shape of the pieces should make it easy to narrow down the number of possibilities of how the pieces go together to a reasonable amount, and then the data is&amp;nbsp;recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Granted, CDs are explicitly designed to handle scratches, while the human brain isn&amp;#8217;t designed to handle incisions, and the size of structures in CDs is vastly larger than dendrites, but the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; in a meat grinder example is a better argument in favor of information theoretic preservation than against&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &amp;#8216;what it&amp;#8217;s designed for&amp;#8217; criterion is quite substantive. I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure one could breed creatures which could survive freezing after a few million generations, but we humans weren&amp;#8217;t bred that way, so we&amp;nbsp;can&amp;#8217;t.&lt;/p&gt;

Where is the evidence that what they&amp;#8217;re actually doing now is any&amp;nbsp;better?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling it a &amp;#8220;scam&amp;#8221; is a tricky one &amp;mdash; the cryonics industry is, generally speaking, not actually engaged in knowing, deliberate fraud. But there&amp;#8217;s no evidence it&amp;#8217;s not presently profound foolishness to bother spending a large sum of money&amp;nbsp;on.&lt;/p&gt;

Anyone with the hindsight of today&amp;#8217;s science can plainly see that there is no comparison, as mummification does not even keep the brain&amp;nbsp;around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The science of cryonics may or may not be &amp;#8220;sufficiently good&amp;#8221; but the case for it not being sufficiently good is not anywhere near as strong as the case against egyptian methods of&amp;nbsp;preservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Putting a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; through a grinder would separate and mix the pieces quite a bit. If they were intact, and sufficient context remained to put them back together like a puzzle (in other words, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; contained predictable data, or the shapes of the plastic fragments were well preserved) it might be possible to reconstruct it even so. With cryonics we have an additional advantage, in that the pieces are still in more or less the same place they originally&amp;nbsp;were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take out the assumption of eventual nanotech capable of repairing dendrites and such, cryonics (i.e. present-day attempts) does look like a scam. But advocates do not see it as particularly reasonable to assume the converse, given the fact that cryonics opens the door to thousands of years of technological advancement as a possible&amp;nbsp;resolution.&lt;/p&gt;

Because the science behind their preservation technology wasn&amp;#8217;t actually good&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So too, the cryonics industry has shown no evidence that what they do to frozen heads does not similarly screw the pooch. Are the dendrites preserved in a state where their strengths can be measured? How many of them are? For a computer science question: what proportion of interconnects can you randomly trash in a neural net and have it still work&amp;nbsp;usefully?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or is it like running a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CD&lt;/span&gt; through a grinder, then asserting that nanobots will some day exist that can read the pits and reassemble the music, and expecting people to pay you to run CDs through a grinder and save the&amp;nbsp;pieces?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we could do so already, cryonics would be&amp;nbsp;unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

If you were to claim that enough information is present in the hollowed-out skull of a mummy to bring back the personality of the individual, it would be very surprising in terms of today&amp;#8217;s science. Can the same really be said of&amp;nbsp;cryonics?&lt;/p&gt;

Livers just aren&amp;#8217;t that important to personhood, it turns&amp;nbsp;out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ben Best paper (where he grossly distorts the claims of two out of two of the referenced papers I&amp;#8217;ve look up so far) appears to be the current cryonics industry&amp;#8217;s best shot at claiming a scientific rationale for the current cryonics industry&amp;#8217;s activities. I&amp;#8217;ve asked the RationalWiki crowd to research the papers in question and compare what they actually say to the claims in Best&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(The one where Best claims a rat hippocampus was frozen and put back into place in working order is a complete lie, for example, which doesn&amp;#8217;t augur well for the rest. The rabbit&amp;#8217;s kidney claim is grossly exaggerated by best.&amp;nbsp;Etc.)&lt;/p&gt;
