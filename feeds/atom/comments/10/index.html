The &amp;#8220;snarky point of view&amp;#8221; philosophy of RationalWiki rules out useful collaboration, and seems to discourage genuine pride in your work, as evinced by the way that when forced to back down from one lurid accusation against cryonics organisations, you seem to move straight on to the next with no sense of discovery or shame.  However, I hope that the work on the article feeds into edits to the Wikipedia article, where &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPOV&lt;/span&gt; fosters a much more effective&amp;nbsp;cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
