      <p>I&#8217;ve managed to find out more about the Society for Cryobiology <a href="http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/coldwar.html">1982 by-law</a> barring cryonicists.  This is just the documents; I may comment on them in a later post.  Everything here comes from Alcor&#8217;s website; I didn&#8217;t find any other sources, but links of course&nbsp;welcome.  </p>

<p>Section 2.04, Denial of Membership and Discipline of Members, reads in full as follows:<blockquote>Upon a two-thirds vote of the Governors in office, the Board of Governors may refuse membership to applicants, or suspend or expel members (including both individual and institutional members), whose conduct is deemed detrimental to the Society, including applicants or members engaged in or who promote any practice or application which the Board of Governors deems incompatible with the ethical and scientific standards of the Society or as misrepresenting the science of cryobiology, including any practice or application of freezing deceased persons in the anticipation of their reanimation. Every member whose suspension or expulsion is under consideration shall be given written notice thereof at least fourteen (14) days before the vote on such suspension or expulsion, which notice shall state the grounds for the proposed action of the Board of Governors, and such member may petition the Board of Governors in writing before the&nbsp;vote. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.benbest.com/cryonics/CryoFAQ.html">source</a></blockquote>This policy statement accompanies the by-law:<blockquote>
Society for&nbsp;Cryobiology</p>

<p>Policy&nbsp;Statement</p>

<p>The Society for Cryobiology has received inquiries regarding the policy 
of the Society toward the practice of freezing human cadavers in 
anticipation of eventual&nbsp;reanimation.</p>

<p>The Society recognizes and respects the well established freedom of 
individuals to hold and express their own opinions and to act, within 
lawful limits, according to their beliefs.  Preferences regarding 
disposition of the dead are clearly a matter of personal choice and, 
therefore, inappropriate subjects of Society&nbsp;policy.</p>

<p>The Society does, however, take the position that cadaver freezing is 
not science.  The knowledge necessary for the revival of whole mammals 
following freezing and for bringing the dead to life does not currently 
exist and can come only from conscientious and patient research in 
cryobiology, biology, chemistry, and medicine.  The act of freezing a dead 
body and storing it indefinitely on the chance that some future generation 
may restore it to life is an act of faith, not&nbsp;science.</p>

Under threat of litigation from Mike Darwin, the final statement was considerably toned down; I include also earlier drafts that are at greater length.<!--more-->
This is the draft of 1981-09-04:<blockquote>
Society for&nbsp;Cryobiology</p>

<p>Policy Draft:  Cadaver&nbsp;Freezing</p>

<p>The Board of Governors of the Society for Cryobiology has received 
inquiries regarding the policy of the Society toward individuals and 
organizations engaged in the long-term, low temperature storage of human 
cadavers in anticipation of eventual&nbsp;reanimation.</p>

<p>The Board recognizes and respects the well-established freedom of 
individuals to hold and express their own opinions and to act, within 
lawful limits, according to their beliefs.  Preferences regarding 
disposition of the dead are clearly a matter of personal belief and, 
therefore, inappropriate
subjects of Society&nbsp;policy.</p>

<p>The Board also recognizes that the goals of cryobiology include not 
only achieving an understanding of freezing injury and its avoidance but 
also applying this knowledge to the preservation of cells, tissues, organs, 
and organisms.  A future achievement may well be successful mammalian 
cryopreservation.  However complex the social consequences of such a 
development might be, this is no basis for discouraging research in 
cryobiology.  The cryopreservation of biological systems remains a 
legitimate scientific endeavor which the Society for Cryobiology is 
chartered to&nbsp;support.</p>

<p>Current understanding in cryobiology is at best fragmentary.  Many 
cells and tissues are refractory to cryopreservation by the best available 
techniques.  There is no confirmed report of successful cryopreservation of 
an intact animal organ.  It can be stated unequivocally that mammalian 
cryopreservation cannot be achieved by current&nbsp;technology.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, certain organizations and individuals are advocating that 
persons be frozen subsequent to death on the premise that science may 
ultimately develop the capability both to reverse the injury of freezing 
and revive the cadaver.  The Board does not choose to involve itself in a 
discussion of the degree of remoteness of this possibility.  The Board 
does, however, take the position that cadaver freezing is not an 
experimental procedure from which anything can be learned.  The knowledge 
necessary for revival of whole animals following freezing and for revival 
of the dead will come not by freezing cadavers but from conscientious and 
patient research in cryobiology, biology, chemistry, and medicine.  The 
sole motivation for freezing cadavers today is the remote hope on the part 
of the individuals that this may be a means of avoiding death.  It is an 
exercise in faith, not science.  Furthermore, to encourage individuals to 
invest many tens of thousands of dollars in post-mortem freezing with the 
implication of ultimate reanimation borders more on fraud than either faith 
or&nbsp;science.</p>

<p>The Board finds human cadaver freezing to be at this time a practice 
devoid of scientific or social value and inconsistent with the ethical and 
scientific standards of the Society.  The Board recommends to the Society 
that membership be denied to organizations or individuals actively engaged 
in this&nbsp;practice.</p>

And three more drafts:<blockquote>
[The following are drafts of a proposed policy statement on &#8220;cadaver 
freezing&#8221; to be issued by the Society for Cryobiology.  We understand that 
the first two drafts were authored by Dr. Harold Meryman.  The third 
revision is authored by Dr. David&nbsp;Pegg.]</p>

<p>4 September&nbsp;1981</p>

<p><span class="caps">PROPOSED</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">STATEMENT</span></p>

<p>The Board of Governors of the Society for Cryobiology has received 
inquiries regarding the policies of the Society towards the Cryonics 
Society, the Life Extension Society and other groups whose objectives 
included the cryopreservation of the human&nbsp;body.</p>

<p>The Board recognizes and respect the well established freedom of 
individuals to hold their own opinions regarding death and their right to 
select such tactics as they may choose to deal with it.  That any 
individual should consider cryopreservation as an alternative to 
conventional death is a matter of personal belief rather than science and 
is no more a matter for Society concern than any other individual faith or&nbsp;philosophy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in light of current scientific understanding of 
freezing injury to cells and tissues, even in the presence of 
cryopreservatives, the Board finds unequivocally that the prospects of 
reanimation of a cryopreserved human, particularly a legally dead human, 
are zero.  The Board also finds specious the argument that science can 
ultimately find a way to reverse both freezing injury and the cause of 
death.  We believe that the prospects for the physical and mental 
reanimation of humans frozen by current technology are&nbsp;nil.</p>

<p>The Board recommends to the Society that it adopt an absolute and 
unequivocal position in opposition to the current practice of human body 
freezing.  In particular, we deplore the practice of cryopreservation for 
hire which, in view of the implied promise of eventual reanimation, we 
consider an act more of fraud than of&nbsp;faith.</p>

<p>Membership in the Society for Cryobiology shall be denied
to organizations or individuals actively endorsing or engaging in the 
practice of human body&nbsp;freezing.</p>

<p>(If the Board approves this policy, it should be ratified by the 
membership at the next&nbsp;meeting.)</p>

<p><span class="caps">SUGGESTED</span> <span class="caps">REVISION</span> <span class="caps">OF</span> <span class="caps">STATEMENT</span> <span class="caps">ON</span> <span class="caps">BODY</span>&nbsp;<span class="caps">FREEZING</span></p>

<p><span class="caps">DAVID</span> <span class="caps">PEGG</span>&nbsp;31/3/82</p>

<p>The Board of Governors of the Society for Cryobiology has received 
enquiries regarding policies of the Society towards the Cryogenic Society, 
the Life Extension Society, and other groups whose objective includes the 
cryopreservation of the human&nbsp;body.</p>

<p>The Board recognizes and respects the freedom of individuals to hold 
their own opinions regarding death and their right to select such 
procedures as they may choose to deal with it.  That any individual should 
consider freezing as an alternative to burial or cremation is a matter of 
personal belief rather than science and is no more a matter for Society 
concern than any other individual faith or&nbsp;philosophy.</p>

<p>However, some cryonics groups do not restrict themselves to the view 
that freezing is an alternative to burial or cremation.  They also state or 
strongly imply that there is a finite possibility that the frozen corpse 
could some day be reanimated.  This view is properly subject to scientific 
judgement.  The Board of the Society for Cryobiology finds that there is no 
adequate experimental basis for this belief, and in light of current 
scientific understanding of freezing injury in cells and tissues, even in 
the presence of cryo-preservatives, it is the Board&#8217;s scientific judgement 
that the prospects for re-animation of a frozen human, particularly a 
legally dead human, are infinitesimally low.  Accordingly, we oppose and 
deplore the practice of human body freezing for hire which in view of the 
implied promise of eventual re-animation, we consider to be at best an act 
of scientifically unfounded optimism, and at worst an act of&nbsp;fraud.</p>

  <p>Cryonicists also became intolerant of any public assertion on the part of cryobiologists that cryonics or its practitioners were engaged in fraud. Communications were sent apprising the Society that assertions that cryonics was fraud constituted both a serious criminal and civil allegation and that appropriate legal action would be taken if such allegations continued (cf. Series of letters from Robert Ettinger and Michael Darwin sent to the Society in the mid 1980&#8217;s: specifically Letter from <span class="caps">M.G.</span> Darwin to <span class="caps">H.T.</span> Meryman dated 21 April, 1982). As a result, by and large, allegations of fraud&nbsp;ceased.</p>

    <div class="text"><p>Capital letters and writing things in red don&#8217;t actually make your case stronger, you know. Pseudoscientists also breathe and wear shoes, but they aren&#8217;t big red&nbsp;flags.</p>

<p>Do you really believe that a non-pseudoscientific business, accused of actual fraud by a major body in a related area, would be very unlikely to threaten to&nbsp;sue?</p>

    <div class="text"><p>Note that <a rel="nofollow" href="http://rationalwiki.com/wiki/Talk:Cryonics#Science_or_pseudoscience.3F">after a long discussion</a> David has toned down the writing in the RationalWiki which used to argue that threatening to sue over the allegation of fraud is evidence of pseudoscience.  He&nbsp;writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span class="caps">FWIW</span> &mdash; on consideration, I&#8217;ve taken out the bit where I suggest that threatening to sue suggests they&#8217;re pseudoscientists, and just left it at the bare fact that they did, because of the use of the word &#8220;fraud&#8221; &mdash; David Gerard (talk) 21:52, 16 February 2010&nbsp;(<span class="caps">UTC</span>)</p>

    <div class="text"><p>Nonsense.  Litigation was only threatened for the use of the word &#8220;fraud&#8221;.  There was no attempt to pretend that legitimate questions about science constituted allegations of fraud, as there is with the <span class="caps">BCA</span>/Singh case; the specific bone of contention was the use of the word &#8220;fraud&#8221; in relation to the core business of Alcor.  Hardly a business on the planet would not threaten to sue if they learned that you planned to brand them fraudsters as publically as&nbsp;possible.</p>
